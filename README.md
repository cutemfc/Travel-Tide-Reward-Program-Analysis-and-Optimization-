## Travel-Tide-Reward-Program-Analysis-and-Optimization
### Goal:
The primary mission of the Travel Tide Rewards Program is customer retention through targeted, data-driven reward allocation. The goal is to identify active users and provide personalized perks based on customer demographics and travel behaviors.

### Description:
This project involved EDA, data preprocessing, feature eingering, pca reduction dimention and unsupervised machine learning (kmeans and DBscan) and integrate clusters with the feature table.

### Key tasks:
Data exploration and filtering by SQL.

Data preprocessing, feature engineering, PCA treatment, visualization, K-means/DBSCAN clustering, and model evaluations.

Integration of clusters with feature tables followed by further data exploration to identify specific features of cluster.

Determine the most suitable reward perks and visualization by Tableau.

### Skills:
Data querying and filtering using SQL.

Data cleaning, exploration (numpy, pandas, and seaborn), and visualization (matplotlib).

Standardization of numeric variables (sklearn.preprocessing).

Unsupervised machine learning modeling (sklearn).

Model evaluation (sklearn.metrics).

Visualization by Tableau

Technology: Python (Sklearn, numpy, pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib)
Key Insights:
Age Segments: Three distinct age groups dominate the active user base - young adults middle-aged individuals, and retirees.
Gender Imbalance: Active users are predominantly female without children, highlighting a demographic imbalance and opportunity for expansion
User Segmentation and Assigned Perks: Through a validated model considering demographic and behavioral factors, 6,378 users were segmented into six groups.
(1) Dreamers (9.3%)
    Characteristics: Active users not yet booking trips
    Assigned Perk: Free cancellation fees
    
(2) Family Travel (32.9%)
    Characteristics: Young/middle-aged families, high baggage use
    Assigned Perk: Free checked bags
    
(3)Loyal Customers (6.7%)
    Characteristics: Highest tenure and engagement
    Assigned Perk: Exclusive discounts, birthday rewards
    
(4)Premium Travel Adventurers (5.4%)
   Characteristics: Longer stays, high flight costs
   Assigned Perk: One free hotel night
   
(5)Mature Regular Travelers (36.8%)
  Characteristics: Frequent, cost-effective travelers
  Assigned Perk: Complimentary tour guides
  
(6)Value Voyagers (8.9%)
 Characteristics: Budget-conscious, low trip frequency
 Assigned Perk: Budget-friendly options, free hotel meal
Recommendations: (1) Expand the 'Mature Regular Traveler' group due to its stable, high-frequency travel behavior. (2) Collaborate with travel companies to offer brochures and guided tours, encouraging new registrations post-March. (3) Address Demographic Imbalance:
Increase engagement with male customers through targeted marketing.
Introduce family-friendly travel packages.
Expand reach into the Canadian market
